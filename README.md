# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
The goal is to identify distinct customer groups that can help businesses improve marketing strategies.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Elbow Method
- K-Means Clustering
- Data Visualization

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Handled missing values and scaled features
3. Applied the Elbow Method to find optimal K
4. Built K-Means model
5. Visualized clusters

## ✅ Results
The model successfully grouped customers into meaningful clusters based on similarity patterns.
